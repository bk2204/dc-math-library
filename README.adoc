= dc Math Library

== What is this?

The Unix calculator bc provides a math library when invoked with -l.  This
provides a small number of useful functions.  Using these functions, it's
possible to compute arbitrary exponentiations, logarithms, Ï€, e, and lots of
other neat things.

dc, on which bc is based, does not provide a math library.  This is that missing
math library.
